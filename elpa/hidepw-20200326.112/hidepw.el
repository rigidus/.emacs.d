;;; Commentary:

;; This is a minor mode for hiding passwords.  It's useful if you
;; manage your passwords in text files (perhaps automatically
;; encrypted and decrypted by EasyPG) and want to prevent shoulder
;; surfing.
;;
;; When enabled, any passwords will appear as ******, but you'll still
;; be able to copy the password to the clipboard.
;;
;; By default, passwords are marked by delimiting them with braces ([]).
;; For example:
;;
;; root: [supersecret]
;;
;; will display as
;;
;; root: [******]
;;
;; You can customize hidepw-pattern to match against arbitrary regular
;; expressions.  Just make sure to include one capturing group (\(\))
;; since the group marks the actual password.  You can also customize
;; the mask (******) that obscures the password.
;;
;; You can enable hidepw-mode automatically on .gpg files with:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.gpg\\'" . hidepw-mode))
;;
;; Using with pass (https://www.passwordstore.org/):
;;
;; pass requires that the first line of the file is a password.  To hide
;; the first line, customize the hidepw-hide-first-line variable.
;;
;; Differences from password-mode (https://github.com/juergenhoetzel/password-mode/):
;;
;; |                   | password-mode   | hidepw                    |
;; |-------------------+-----------------+---------------------------|
;; | hiding via        | overlay         | font-lock                 |
;; | password input    | password prompt | normal input              |
;; | match via         | prefix regexp   | regexp with capture group |
;; | multiple patterns | yes             | yes                       |
;; | supports pass     | no*             | yes                       |
;;
;; While the password prompt is a nice feature of password-mode, I found
;; it to be difficult to use and that it could get into inconsistent states.
;; If you'd like to input passwords without them ever being visible, input the
;; delimiters ([]) first and then input the password between them.
;;
;; * It might be possible to use pass with password-mode with the right
;; regexp.
;;
;; Notes:
;;
;; You won't be able to move the cursor within the password (it will
;; behave like a single character), but deleting the delimiter from
;; either side will reveal the password and make it editable.  Just add
;; the delimiter back to hide it again.
;;
;; This mode turns on font-lock-mode (and won't turn it off when you
;; turn off this mode).
